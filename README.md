## Problem 1

Write a program that analyzes the data in the file named `people.csv` within the `data` subdirectory and outputs how many people are from each country mentioned in the file. Use `pandas` and `numpy` to solve this problem.

The output should be formatted as follows:

```
There are 3 people from France.
There are 2 people from Germany.
There is 1 person from Italy.
There is 1 person from Spain.
... etc...
```

## Problem 2

Write a program that meets the same requirements of Problem 1, but does not use `pandas` and `numpy`.
